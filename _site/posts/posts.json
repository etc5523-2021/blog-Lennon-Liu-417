The research timeline is from the first infection at 2020-02-07 to 2021-09-13. The details of the tidy dataset is shown below:\nData Dictionary\n\n\nTable 1: Data Description of coronavirus dataset\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n1\n\n\ncountry\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\nThe country in Africa\n\n\n2\n\n\ndate\n\n\ndate\n\n\nThe observation date\n\n\n3\n\n\ntotal_cases\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nTotal number of confirmed cases of COVID-19\n\n\n4\n\n\nnew_cases\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nThe number of new cases per day\n\n\n5\n\n\nnew_deaths\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nTotal number of new deaths per day\n\n\n6\n\n\ntotal_vaccinations_per_hundred\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nCumulative total vaccine doses administered per 100 population\n\n\n7\n\n\npeople_vaccinated_per_hundred\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nCumulative persons vaccinated with at least one dose per 100 population\n\n\n8\n\n\npeople_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nCumulative number of persons fully vaccinated per 100 population\n\n\n9\n\n\ngeometry\n\n\nS3: sfc_MULTIPOLYGON\n\n\nCountry Polygons\n\n\nAnalysis and Exploration\nFirstly, The distribution of total cases in each country in Africa is shown by using a map below.\n\n\n\nFrom the above map, it is clear to see the serious situation of COVID-19 in South Africa. Then Morocco and Tunisia followed, the total cases in Morocco has exceeded 900,000, and Tunisia is approaching 700,000.

the above two figures, it is found that the COVID-19 outbreak began in March 2020 in Africa, and there have been three peak values in cases so far. The first peak was in mid-July 2020, and the highest number of new cases in a single day was 13,944. At the same time, the highest number of deaths in a single day was 572. Due to the influence of global variant strains, the number of cases and deaths in South Africa peaked again in January 2020 and surpassed the first. The average number of deaths per week has reached the first peak of the maximum number of deaths in a single day. Although the number of daily cases and weekly average cases in the third peak exceeded the previous two times, the mortality rate was controlled to some extent. The average weekly deaths was 400, well below the second peak of 575. This suggests that vaccines and control measures have improved the cure rate.\nCovid-19 Vaccination Status\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"top\",\"filterHTML\":\"<tr>\\n  <td><\\/td>\\n  <td

vaccination start time is February 2021. From the trend chart in the table, it can be seen that the trend growth is relatively slow whether it is at least one injection or the vaccination has been completed. Due to the shortage of vaccines, the vaccination rate for at least one injection in a single day is 17.06%, and the full vaccinated vaccination rate is only 11.27%.\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"x\":[18674,18676,18677,18678,18679,18680,18681,18682,18683,18684,18685,18686,18687,18688,18689,18690,18691,18692,18693,18694,18695,18696,18697,18698,18699,18701,18702,18703,18704,18705,18709,18710,18711,18712,18713,18715,18716,18717,18718,18723,18724,18725,18726,18727,18729,18730,18745,18746,18747,18748,18750,18751,18752,18754,18755,18757,18758,18759,18760,18761,18762,18763,18764,18765,18766,18767,18768,18769,18770,18771,18772,18773,18774,18775,18776,18777,18778,18779,18780,18781,18782,18783,18784,18785,18786,18787,18788,18789,18790,18791,18792,18793,18794,18795,18796,18797,18799,18802,18803,18804,18805,18806,18807,18808,18809,18811,18812,18813,18814,18816,18817,18818,18820,18821,18823,18827,18828,18830,18831,18833,18834,18835,18837,18840,18841,18842,18844,18847,18849,18851,18854,18855,18857,18858,18859,18861,18862,18863,18866,18869,18870,18871,18872,18875,18877,18879,18880,18881,18882,18882,18882,18881,18880,18879,18877,18875,18872,18871,18870,18869,18866,18863,18862,18861,18859,18858,18857,18855,18854,18851,18849,18847,18844,18842,18841,18840,18837,18835,18834,18833,18831,18830,18828,18827,18823,18821,18820,18818,18817,18816,18814,18813,18812,18811,18809,18808,18807,18806,18805,18804,18803,18802,18799,18797,18796,18795,18794,18793,18792,18791,18790,18789,18788,18787,18786,18785,18784,18783,18782,18781,18780,18779,18778,18777,18776,18775,18774,18773,18772,18771,18770,18769,18768,18767,18766,18765,18764,18763,18762,18761,18760,18759,18758,18757,18755,18754,18752,18751,18750,18748,18747,18746,18745,18730,18729,18727,18726,18725,18724,18723,18718,18717,18716,18715,18713,18712,18711,18710,18709,18705,18704,18703,18702,18701,18699,18698,18697,18696,18695,18694,18693,18692,18691,18690,18689,18688,18687,18686,18685,18684,18683,18682,18681,18680,18679,18678,18677,18676,18674,18674],\"y\":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.47,24.43,24.33,23.53,23.14,22.41,21.84,21.39,20.93,20.47,19.86,18.45,17.97,17.45,17.37,16.93,16.59,15.92,15.63,15.3,14.68,14.33,13.63,13.29,12.6,12.58,12.15,11.42,11.02,10.63,10.51,10.13,8.87,8.49,8.4,7.55,7.31,7.06,7,6.69,6.05,5.77,5.52,5.51,5.26,5.04,4.83,4.64,4.63,4.47,4.43,4.25,3.71,3.57,3.56,3.45,3.29,3.27,3.12,2.96,2.95,2.94,2.81,2.7,2.54,2.39,2.25,2.24,2.23,2.11,1.99,1.86,1.74,1.62,1.61,1.61,1.5,1.38,1.27,1.17,1.09,1.08,1.07,0.99,0.93,0.86,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.79,0.76,0.72,0.69,0.66,0.64,0.63,0.61,0.59,0.55,0.53,0.53,0.51,0.5,0.49,0.48,0.48,0.48,0.47,0.46,0.45,0.45,0.44,0.42,0.4,0.39,0.38,0.37,0.35,0.32,0.3,0.3,0.28,0.26,0.25,0.24,0.24,0.23,0.21,0.18,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.15,0.14,0.13,0.12,0.12,0.11,0.11,0.09,0.07,0.05,0.04,0.03,0.02,0.01,0,0,0],\"text\":[\"date:

figure above shows that the number of people receiving at least one dose of the vaccine has increased significantly since the end of May 2021, and the growth is steady. Additionally, the number of people fully vaccinated had a sharp increase in mid-July 2021, and the growth rate of the number of people who have received the vaccine after this is very similar to the rate of at least one dose. At the same time, because of the gradual vaccination, the mortality rate of the third outbreak in South Africa has been greatly reduced.\nReferences\nHannah Ritchie, Edouard Mathieu, Lucas Rodés-Guirao, Cameron Appel, Charlie Giattino, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina, Joe Hasell, Bobbie Macdonald, Diana Beltekian and Max Roser (2020) - “Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19)”.

This blog uses Poland as the research object to explore the infection and death of the new coronavirus in Poland, as well as the subsequent vaccination situation. The research timeline is from the first infection at 2020-03-04 to 2021-08-31. The details of data is shown below:\nData Dictionary:\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\ndate\n\n\ndate\n\n\nThe observation date\n\n\ntotal_cases\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nTotal number of confirmed cases of COVID-19\n\n\nnew_cases\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nThe number of new cases per day\n\n\ntotal_deaths\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nTotal number of deaths of COVID-19\n\n\nnew_deaths\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nTotal number of confirmed cases per million\n\n\ntotal_cases_per_million\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nTotal number of deaths per million\n\n\ntotal_deaths_per_million\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nTotal number of new deaths per day\n\n\ntotal_vaccinations\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nCumulative total vaccine doses administered\n\n\ntotal_vaccinations_per_hundred\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nCumulative total vaccine doses administered per 100 population\n\n\npeople_fully_vaccinated\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nCumulative number of persons fully vaccinated\n\n\npeople_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred\n\n\ndouble\n\n\nCumulative number of persons fully vaccinated per 100 population\n\n\nAnalysis and Exploration\nFirstly, we see the last situation of COVID-19 cases and deaths at 2021-08-31 in Poland. The percentage of infections per million people is 7.64%, and The percentage of deaths per million people is 0.20.\n\n\nTable 1: Last situation of COVID-19 in

peaks of daily cases were in November 2020 and March 2021, and the highest average number of daily cases in November 2020 is 20936. However, the highest average number of daily deaths is at April 2021, approximately at 482.\nAccording to the table above, we can see that the situation of COVID-19 in Poland declined from December 2020 to February 2021, but was followed by a repeat of the pandemic with monthly deaths surpassing the first wave. The main reasons for the resurgence of the pandemic are the re-emergence of the global outbreak since March 2021 and the emergence of multiple mutated strains in Europe. The Polish government extended the lockdown on March 15 in response to the worsening outbreak. The outbreak was brought under control in May, with the daily average number of new cases only 16.5% of April’s, and the death toll halved.\nNumerical Summary Statistics\nThis correlation table contains the correlation coefficients which can give a overview and supply parameter values for analysis.
